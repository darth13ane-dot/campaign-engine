# Sharing and desktop updates

Double-click **Build Campaign Engine.cmd** or run `pnpm run dist`. This produces:

- an NSIS Setup executable for normal installation and automatic updates;
- a portable executable with in-app, no-install updates;
- `latest.yml` and a blockmap for the installed-app updater.
- `latest-portable.json` for the portable updater.

See `WINDOWS_APP.md` for the complete build, backup, and automated-release workflow.

## Enabling in-app updates

Host `latest.yml`, `latest-portable.json`, both Windows executables, and the installer blockmap together at a trusted HTTPS address. GitHub tag builds publish these files automatically.

The release workflow embeds its GitHub Releases download address. Manual release preparation requires the equivalent HTTPS address before it builds. You can override it inside the installed app under **App updates**. Campaign Engine checks when it opens and every six hours; changing the automatic-check setting reschedules those checks immediately. Downloads and installation remain explicit.

Portable builds use Campaign Engine's dedicated portable updater because electron-updater officially supports the Windows NSIS target, not the portable target. Portable downloads are size-checked and SHA-512 verified before the original executable is replaced and reopened.

## Private campaign data

Windows release builds contain empty Archivist stubs. The live campaign workspace and full Archivist details are stored under `%APPDATA%\Campaign Engine` and travel only through backups the user explicitly creates. Application upgrades do not overwrite that workspace.

Saved AI credentials also live under `%APPDATA%\Campaign Engine`, encrypted for the current Windows account and outside both the executable and workspace backups. This keeps the key stable across portable updates without putting it in a transferable campaign file.
